# myShell

myShell is a basic shell application that lets you execute commands and other programs from a command line.

# Basic Usage

First, run the `myshell` application in a terminal window.

You should see something like the following:

```
/home/user $
```

This is the prompt for you to enter a command.

The current directory that you are working in is listed at the start of the prompt. In this case, it is `/home/julian`.

To run a command, enter one and press the enter key:

```
/home/user $ cd Documents
/home/user/Documents $
```

You can run external programs by specifying their path (or, if they're in a directory on the `$PATH`, just specify their name like a built-in command):

```
/home/user $ ./hello
Hello, World!
```

## Built-In Commands

### `cd`

The `cd` command lets you change the current directory that you are working in.

```
/home/user $ cd Documents
/home/user/Documents $
```

### `clr`

The `clr` command clears the entire screen of any text and returns the cursor back to the top left.

### `dir`

The `dir` command lists all files and folders in a specific path.

If no path is specified, the current directory will be used.

```
/home/user $ dir Documents
.
..
Resume.docx
/home/user $ dir
.
..
Desktop
Documents
Pictures
Videos
```

### `environ`

The `environ` command lists all environment variables that are currently set.

```
/home/user $ environ
TMPDIR=/tmp
USER=user
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
SHELL=/bin/myshell
```

### `echo`

The `echo` command prints whatever comes after it to the screen.

```
/home/user $ echo Hello, World!
Hello, World!
```

### `help`

The `help` command shows this document using the system's `more` utility.

### `pause`

The `pause` command waits for you to press enter before proceeding.

```
/home/user $ pause
Press enter to continue...
/home/user $
```

### `quit`

The `quit` command closes the shell.
